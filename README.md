研究中国古籍、历史和神话
research china daozang and history and mythology
历史与神话不断重写，不断衍生。因果倒转，历史神话如同画板，不断改写重构，今日所见所闻如水中画，砂之塔，我们活在其中，察觉不到变化，我能否从程序员角度，去展现祂？
History and mythology are constantly rewritten and reinterpreted. Cause and effect are inverted; history and myth are like canvases, perpetually altered and reconstructed. What we see and hear today is like a painting on water or a tower of sand. We live within it, unaware of the changes. Can I, from a programmer's perspective, reveal its nature?
